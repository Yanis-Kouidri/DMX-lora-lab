## Structure

- `Mote/`: Contains a Python 3.14 project managed with `uv`. These files are written to communicate with the Microchip RN2483 LoRa Technology Mote in order to send instructions to it.
- `LoRaWAN-Infra/`: Contains a docker-compose file and configuration files to run the LoRaWAN stack.
- `secret-example.md`: A template file used to structure secrets safely.

## Guardrails

- Never commit a decrypted secret.
- Always use conventional commit messages.
